   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to peasel's documentation!
==================================

Some python wrappers for a little bit of `Sean
Eddy <http://selab.janelia.org/>`_'s excellent
`Easel <http://selab.janelia.org/people/eddys/blog/?p=394>`_ library for
sequence manipulation.

At present, it's just a Python API to the Simple Sequence Index (SSI)
format for rapid sequence retrieval from large files.
